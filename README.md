# Exhibition Wishlist


_I have a group of friends who try to meet every week to visit interesting museums and galleries. We find it hard to track which exhibitions are ending next and therefore should be prioritized, and we would like to plan better who is interested in joining which exhibition._

## ðŸŽ¨ App

Exhibition Wishlist is a web-based app for organizing museum and gallery visits with friends. It allows users to register, log in, add interesting exhibitions, and track which exhibitions each user is interested in. The app also reminds as exhibition end dates approach, and sorts exhibitions in chronological order based on their end dates.
